# Azure Infrastructure as Code Bootcamp Labs

Welcome to the Azure Infrastructure as Code Bootcamp Labs by INE. To get the best experience from this repo, you should have an INE Business or Premium subscription.

This first set of labs is part of our latest bootcamp, but also will support the "Infrastructure as Code" track in the Azure vertical for INE's upcoming hands-on multi-cloud engineer certification (ICCE). These labs are currently in "beta" and I'm open to feedback, and pull requests are happily accepted.

**Note**: Labs 6-8 will be availble in May 2022 when we enable programtic credentials for our Azure labs. This first release only provides a temporary AAD user account that is limited to the Azure Portal/Cloud Shell.

Here are the initial hands-on labs for the Azure Infrastructure as Code Bootcamp at INE.

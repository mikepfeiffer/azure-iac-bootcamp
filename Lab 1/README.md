# Lab 1 - Create an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Repo in GitHub

To perform this lab you'll need Git and VS Code installed locally. You'll also need a GitHub account. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/join) to sign up if you don't already have an account.

1. Sign into your GitHub account on the web and create a new public repository. This repo will contain all of your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) projects for this bootcamp, so give your repo a meaningful name (e.g. "iac-projects").
2. Clone your new repository to your local machine.
3. Open your repository in VS Code.
4. Create a new README that documents what this repository is all about. This can be simple, don't overthink it... the goal is to get some practice writing markdown.
5. Use Git add, commit, and push to sync your local changes to your GitHub repo.

## Challenge

After you've successfully completed this lab, create a second repo. This time intialize the repo locally from the commandline (instead of on the web) and then push the repo GitHub.
